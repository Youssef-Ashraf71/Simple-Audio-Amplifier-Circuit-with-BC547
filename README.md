* Connect the 2K ohm resistor between the negative rail and the base of the BC547 transistor.
* Connect the 1 microfarad capacitor between the base of the transistor and the negative rail.
* Connect the collector of the transistor to the positive rail.
* Connect the 0.1 microfarad capacitor between the collector of the transistor and the positive rail.
* Connect the 10K ohm resistor between the base of the transistor and the positive rail.
* Connect the positive terminal of the speaker to the collector of the transistor.
* Connect the negative terminal of the speaker to the negative rail.

## Testing the Circuit
To test the circuit, connect a power source to the positive and negative rails of the breadboard. Speak into the microphone and you should hear the sound amplified through the speaker.

## Conclusion
This simple audio amplifier circuit with a BC547 transistor is an easy project to build and is great for beginners who want to learn about amplifying sound. Have fun building!
